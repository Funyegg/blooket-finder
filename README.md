# blooket-finder
A NodeJS program for finding random blooket codes.
# Usage
1. Download NodeJS
2. Run "node finder.js" in the blooket finder's home directory (with the command line). No external dependencies required.
3. Wait. It may take a minute or few to find a code.
4. When the program ends, copy the last blooket code.
5. Go to https://play.blooket.com/play and paste the blooket code. Have fun messing around.
# How I did it
I used the "network" tab in inspect element to see what blooket was sending as I joined a game. I used the data to work out some basics about the API (Though I still can't join games with bots).
# Why I did it
I was bored, one of my friends kept inviting me to photography blookets to fuck around so I got this idea.
